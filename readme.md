# Simple Dice Game - JavaScript DOM Practice

This JavaScript code implements a two-player dice game using the DOM API. Players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate scores, with the added rule that rolling a 1 resets the current player's score to 0. The game also includes features such as switching players, holding scores, and declaring a winner.
The winning score is set to 20, and the "New Game" button resets the game to its initial state. Designed for practicing DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic.
